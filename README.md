# Luau Hashing

Pure Luau implementations of several hashing algorithms. Blazing fast (for Luau) and well-tested.

Modules reside in their own folders under `modules` and have their own READMEs with documentation. Additionally, each module is published on [Wally](https://wally.run/) for convenience.
